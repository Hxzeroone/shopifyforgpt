        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Personal Information Collected</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information you provide to us - When you register for our service, we ask for your Shopify Store URL and support email.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Use of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to provide and improve our services. This includes operating, maintaining, and providing to you all of the content and features of the service.</p>

        <h2>3. Use of APIs</h2>
        <p>
        We use the Gmail API for connecting your Gmail account to our service in order to manage support tickets.
        We also use the Shopify API for synchronizing your Shopify orders into our service. The usage of these APIs
        is in accordance with their respective terms of service.
        </p>
        <h2>Google Gmail API</h2>
<p>Our service uses the Gmail API for improved customer service interactions. This integration allows our service to streamline and automate support communications for Shopify store owners. Specifically, here's how we use this API:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Email Access:</strong> We access incoming customer emails from the connected Gmail account. This allows our application to analyze the content of customer inquiries and generate appropriate responses. This data is accessed and processed in real time, and we do not store your emails.</li>
    <li><strong>Sending Emails:</strong> Our system sends emails on behalf of users to respond to customer inquiries. These email responses can be auto-generated by our AI model, or they can be drafted by support agents using suggested responses from the AI.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversation Context:</strong> By having access to email threads, our AI can understand the context of ongoing conversations. This improves the accuracy and relevancy of our AI's responses, enhancing the overall customer experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shopify API</h2>
<p>We integrate with Shopify API to enhance the functionality of our service. This allows us to provide a seamless and efficient customer support system for Shopify store owners. Specifically, here's how we use this API:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Order Data:</strong> We access and process order data from the connected Shopify store. This data is used to inform the AI model about order statuses, product information, and other order-related details, enabling it to provide accurate responses to customer inquiries related to orders.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Data:</strong> We also access customer data to personalize and enhance the customer service experience. However, this data is processed in real time and is not stored on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Shop Management:</strong> With the Shopify API, our system can interact with shop management functions, which allows us to auto-generate responses that can guide customers on product inquiries, shipping details, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the extensive integration, we ensure that the Gmail & Shopify API is used strictly for the stated functionality. We respect user privacy and are committed to maintaining the security of user data. The  data used by our application is exclusively used for improving the quality of customer service interactions and is not stored or used for any other purposes. We comply with all relevant privacy laws and regulations in relation to the use of the API.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our service and we hold certain information.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share your personal information with third parties in order to provide our services. These third parties are not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose than to provide the service.</p>

<p>Our service employs OpenAI's ChatGPT to facilitate efficient and accurate customer service interactions. It's important to clarify that the use of ChatGPT takes place within the user's own environment, using the user's own OpenAI API key. As such, we as service providers do not have direct access to the data processed by OpenAI. Here's how we use this API:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Inquiry Analysis:</strong> We use the AI model to analyze customer inquiries collected from the user's Gmail account and generate appropriate responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Information Processing:</strong> The AI model processes order data from the user's connected Shopify store to provide accurate and relevant responses to order-related inquiries.</li>
    <li><strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> By processing email threads and order data, ChatGPT is able to understand the context of ongoing conversations and provide more accurate and relevant responses.</li>
</ul>

<p>All data processed by the OpenAI API is done so in real time and is not stored on our servers or in the user's OpenAI account. The sole purpose of this data processing is to enhance customer service interactions.</p>

<p>Rest assured that the OpenAI API key provided by the user is used strictly for the stated functionality, and we are committed to maintaining its confidentiality and security. As with all third-party integrations, we comply with all relevant privacy laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>User Consent</h3>
<p>Our application emphasizes acquiring explicit user consent before any data processing occurs. By agreeing to this privacy policy, users give explicit approval for our application to share data with third-party tools like Gmail, Shopify, and OpenAI's ChatGPT. The consent process includes the following stages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Users are informed about the data that will be processed and shared with third-party tools. A detailed description of the types of data these tools will have access to, and how this data will be used to enhance the service, is provided.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent Agreement:</strong> As a mandatory step, users must explicitly agree to our privacy policy, thereby granting consent for data sharing with Shopify, and OpenAI. The service cannot be used without this agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>API Key Entry:</strong> Users must manually enter their own API keys for Gmail, Shopify, and OpenAI. This active engagement with data sharing serves as further consent to the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our application provides complete transparency about data usage and sharing. Users have the ability to withdraw their consent at any time, which will immediately cease all data processing.</p>

        
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We also strive for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques.</p>

        <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
        <p>Users have the right to view their personal information that we hold and to request the deletion of their personal information.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Breaches</h2>
        <p>In the event of a data breach, we will notify affected users within 72 hours of discovering the breach.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
